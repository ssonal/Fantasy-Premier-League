The [Fantasy Premier League](fantasy.premierleague.com) is an online competition in which users choose their team of 15 players given a budget and a set of constraints. 

This program employs a genetic algorithm to compose the team.

To use :
fplscrape.py scrapes the premierleague website for JSON data which the genetic algorithm then uses. Run the following commands.
	
    python fplscrape.py
	python GA.py

Genetic Algorithm based on https://gist.github.com/arthurrebelo/6689655, which is a python port of http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/creating-a-genetic-algorithm-for-beginners/3 by Lee Jacobson
